# These environment variables are not required.

# Default value is `$$host` which resolves site by host. For example, if your host is `example.com`,
# site's name should be `example.com`, or if host is `127.0.0.1` (local debugging), it should be `127.0.0.1`.
# This variable allows to override described behavior. Let's say you create site named `mysite`
# and do want to access it by `127.0.0.1` host. Than you would set this variable to `mysite`.

# Allowed values are on|off. Default value is `off`. If recursive search is disabled,
# the original client address that matches one of the trusted addresses
# is replaced by the last address sent in the request header field defined by the real_ip_header directive.
# If recursive search is enabled, the original client address that matches one of the trusted addresses is replaced by the last non-trusted address sent in the request header field.
